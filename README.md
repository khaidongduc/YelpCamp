# YelpCamp
Yelp Camp is a fun application that allows you to view campgrounds with a short description.
Once you log in or sign up you can begin to create your own campground that includes a title, image address, and short description.
YelpCamp is a more complex application built from scratch using the following technologies:
On the front-end, I have used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap for responsive layout, and jQuery.
On the back-end, I used NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS, REST, Authentication, Authorization, and PassportJS.
For datastore, I used non-SQL MongoDB.
The application was developed on VSCode and source versioned with GIT.
The application is hosted on Heroku servers.
